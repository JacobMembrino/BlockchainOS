# BlockchainOS
This is an Operating System (OS) used to interact with and securely store blockchain information on USB drives. I believe that true security is built from bare metal up and this is how I'm achieving it.

## Tools 
Start by installing VScode with these extensions:

  --> Amiga C/C++ Compile, Debug & Profile
  
  --> Cortex-Debug
  
  --> C/C++ Extension Pack
  
  --> Code Runner
  
  --> GDB Debug
  
  --> GDB syntax
  
  --> GDB with GPU Debug Support for IntelÂ® oneAPI Toolkits
  
  --> Lua
  
  --> MemoryView
  
  --> Peripheral Viewer
  
  --> RTOS Views

  --> Arm toolchain for Linux
  
For emulating bare-metal: QEMU https://qemu.weilnetz.de/
